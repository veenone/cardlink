It provides device control via serial/USB AT commands, network configuration, BIP event monitoring, QXDM diagnostic integration, and SMS-PP trigger simulation.\n\nThis component enables testers to use dedicated IoT modems for UICC-to-server connections, offering more direct modem access and diagnostic capabilities compared to smartphone-based testing.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports CardLink's core mission of providing accessible SCP81 compliance testing:\n\n- **Real hardware testing**: Uses actual IoT modems with direct AT command access\n- **Local-first design**: Serial/USB connection without network infrastructure\n- **Protocol transparency**: Full AT command logging and QXDM diagnostics\n- **Direct modem access**: No Android OS layer between tester and modem\n- **Industry-standard modules**: Support for Quectel and compatible modems\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Modem Discovery and Connection\n\n**User Story:** As a tester, I want the controller to discover connected IoT modems, so that I can quickly start testing without manual serial port configuration.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.
