The platform eliminates the need for production OTA infrastructure by providing simulated servers, phone control interfaces, and testing utilities, enabling realistic end-to-end validation without requiring access to live mobile networks or commercial OTA platforms.\n\n## Target Users\n\n| Persona | Need |\n|---------|------|\n| **UICC Developer** | Validate SCP81 implementation with real phone stack |\n| **QA Engineer** | Automated regression testing with actual hardware |\n| **MNO Integration Team** | Test OTA platform integration end-to-end |\n| **Device Manufacturer** | Verify BIP/CAT implementation in handsets |\n| **Certification Lab** | Pre-certification testing before formal submission |\n\n### Pain Points Addressed\n- No accessible test infrastructure (expensive commercial tools required)\n- Complex end-to-end stack requiring mobile phone, network, and server coordination\n- BIP connectivity issues with poorly documented UICC-initiated HTTPS connections\n- Limited debugging in production systems that don't expose protocol-level details\n- UICC provisioning complexity with manual and error-prone pre-configuration\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **PSK-TLS Admin Server**: Fully compliant GP Amendment B RAM over HTTP server with PSK-TLS support for secure UICC communication\n2. **ADB-Based Phone Controller**: Android phone control interface for device management, network configuration, AT commands, and BIP event monitoring\n3. **UICC Provisioner**: PC/SC-based card pre-configuration for PSK keys, admin URLs, and trigger mechanisms\n4. **SMS-PP Trigger Simulation**: Local SMS delivery simulation with PDU encoding for OTA triggers\n5. **BIP Event Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of Bearer Independent Protocol events via logcat\n6. **E2E Test Orchestration**: Automated test execution coordinating server, phone, and UICC components\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- Provide accessible SCP81 compliance testing without expensive commercial infrastructure\n- Enable complete end-to-end validation using actual mobile devices and UICC cards\n- Reduce time-to-market for UICC and OTA platform implementations\n- Support pre-certification testing to reduce formal certification failures\n- Create a standardized test framework for GlobalPlatform Amendment B implementations\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Full SCP81 protocol compliance per GP Card Spec v2.2 Amendment B\n- **Test Cycle Time**: Sub-5-second end-to-end test cycle time\n- **Platform Support**: Support for Android 8.0+ phones via ADB interface\n- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites covering smoke, compliance, and E2E scenarios\n- **Hardware Compatibility**: Validated on multiple phone models (Pixel, Samsung, OnePlus)\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Real Hardware Testing**: Use actual mobile phones and UICC cards rather than simulators to ensure realistic validation\n2. **Local-First**: All testing runs locally via USB/ADB without requiring network infrastructure or cloud dependencies\n3. **Protocol Transparency**: Comprehensive logging across all protocol layers for debugging and analysis\n4. **CLI-First Design**: Command-line interface prioritized for automation and scripting (GUI planned for future)\n5. **Modular Architecture**: Separate components (server, phone controller, provisioner) that can be used independently or together\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n- **Dashboard Type**: CLI-based with comprehensive logging output\n- **Real-time Updates**: Live BIP event monitoring via logcat, server session tracking\n- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Connection status, APDU exchanges, test results, timing metrics\n- **Sharing Capabilities**: Log exports, HTML reports, YAML test configurations\n\n## Future Vision\n\n### Version 1.0 Scope\n- Android device support only\n- SCP81 (HTTP-based OTA) only\n- Local USB connection only\n- CLI interface\n- Single device focus\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n- **iOS Support**: Extend phone controller for iOS devices\n- **SCP80 Support**: Add SMS-based OTA testing (legacy protocol)\n- **Remote Phone Control**: Cloud-based phone management for distributed testing\n- **GUI Test Management**: Web-based dashboard for test configuration and results\n- **Multi-Phone Parallel Testing**: Support for testing multiple devices simultaneously\n- **Analytics Dashboard**: Historical test trends, compliance metrics, performance analysis\n",
